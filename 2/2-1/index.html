      Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for
      documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by
      technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages
      such as JavaScript.
    </p>
    <p>
      Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local
      storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes
      the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for
      the appearance of the document.
